\part{Abstract Algebra}\label{part:abstract-algebra}
The following is an excerpt from \cite{pinter}:

Thus, we are led to the modern notion of algebraic structure. An \emph{algebraic structure} is understood to be an arbitrary set, with one or more operations defined on it. And algebra, then, is defined to be \emph{the study of algebraic structures}.

It is important that we be awakened to the full generality of the notion of algebraic structure. We must make an effort to discard all our preconceived notions of what an algebra is, and look at this new notion of algebraic structure in its naked simplicity. \emph{Any} set, with a rule (or rules) for combining its elements, is already an algebraic structure. There does not need to be any connection with known mathematics. For example, consider the set of all colors (pure colors as well as color combinations), and the operation of mixing any two colors to produce a new color. This may be conceived as an algebraic structure. It obeys certain rules, such as the commutative law (mixing red and blue is the same as mixing blue and red).
