\section{Riesz Representation Theorem}
\begin{theorem}
Let $X$ be a locally compact Hausdorff space, and let $\Lambda$ be a positive linear functional on $C_\epsilon(X)$. Then there exists a $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{M}$ in $X$ which contains all Borel sets in $X$, and there exists a unique positive measure $\mu$ on $\mathcal{M}$ which represents $\Lambda$
